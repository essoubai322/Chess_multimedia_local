## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Chessboard Initialization**:
   - The board is rendered as an HTML list with chess pieces represented by list items.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - `logic.js` uses event listeners to validate and execute valid moves.
   - Checkmate detection is handled automatically, ensuring proper game-ending conditions.

3. **Styling**:
